# Ensemble-based-rent-prediction-using-stacking-technique
### 1.1 Objective
The objective of the project is to anticipate real estate pricing based on previously collected, relevant information.[4] The dataset is obtained by scraping a popular Indian rental listing website with 18 variables including the number of rooms, bathrooms, amenities available, and size among others which are factors that can influence the price of a house. This data is pre-processed and trained using seven regression algorithms and boosting methods namely AdaBoost, CatBoost, LightGBM, XGBoost, KRR, ENet Lasso regression and Stacked Regressor - formed by the best combination of the aforementioned algorithms, which is an ensemble model used for obtaining better accuracy.
### 1.2 Motivation
The real estate industry is growing by the minute and hence advanced and accurate predictions of prices of listings are the need of the hour. The market is changing all the time, and today many software juggernauts are turning to artificial intelligence for improved decisions and resolving certain complex real-world problems using large amounts of data. Machine learning has now become interdisciplinary and can be incorporated into a variety of industries including real estate so that it can aid not only investors to increase their business throughput but also give individuals access to accurate information about properties within their financial limits. As a result, the ML models have the potential to take into account a wide range of criteria while analyzing patterns in order to provide efficient results in terms of complexity and accuracy[3]
